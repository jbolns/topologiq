# What is this folder?
This folder is only used locally. It contains data files which are helpful to:
- understand and improve runtimes
- understand and improve space-time volume performance
- understand edge cases that might helpf in debugging.

## Why are there no data files in the folder?
The actual .CSV files with data for analytics remain local.

To create data files, give the main `runner.py` function the optional parameter `log_stats: bool = True`. This will trigger the creation a unique identifier for the run, and automated logging to the following files:
- graph_manager.csv: statistics about the outer BFS cycle,
- pathfinder.csv: statistics about each individual edge path sent to the inner pathfinder algorithm,
- params.csv: outputs and run parameters for specific runs.
- debug.csv: output and run parameters for specific runs that can assist debugging (failed runs or runs using atypical beam lengths or atypical hyperparameters).

Please note. Statistics are NOT logged by default. A regular failed run will NOT be logged unless `log_stats` is set to `True`.

## Schemas
Schemas are as follows:

### Graph manager (one log per cycle/circuit run)
- unique_run_id: the unique identifier for the specific run of the full algorithmic flow,
- run_success: whether the process was successful, i.e., it produced a complete lattice surgery/space-time diagram of the original circuit,
- circuit_name: the name of the circuit,
- len_beams: the length of the beams used for the specific run,
- num_input_nodes_processed: the number of nodes in the original/input ZX graph that were processed successfully,
- num_input_edges_processed: the number of edges in the original/input ZX graph that were processed successfully,
- num_1st_pass_edges_processed: the number of normal edges (edges between a "placed" block and a "new" one yet to be assigned coordinates and kind) in the original/input ZX graph that were processed successfully,
- num_2n_pass_edges_processed: the number of special edges (edges between nodes placed as part of the "first pass") in the original/input ZX graph that were processed successfully,
- num_edges_in_edge_paths: the total number of edges in the final set of edges produced by the algorithm (same as `num_input_edges_processed` if `run_success==True`),
- num_blocks_output: the number of 3D spider blocks (cubes) in the output,
- num_edges_output: the number of 3D edge blocks (pipes) in the output,
- duration_first_pass: the total duration of the first pass of the algorithm, i.e., the "while" loop that takes care of "first pass" edges,
- duration_second_pass: the total duration of the second pass of the algorithm, i.e., the "while" loop that takes care of "second pass" edges,
- duration_total: the total duration of the entire algorithmic lattice surgery process for this circuit, irrespective of `run_success`. 

### Pathfinder (one log per iteration)
- unique_run_id: the unique identifier for the specific run of the full algorithmic flow,
- iter_type: the type of operation asked, i.e., whether the pathfinder needs to "create" a path between a block that has already been placed in the 3D space and a new one or whether it needs to "discover" a valid path between two blocks that were already placed as part of previous operations,
- iter_success: whether the pathfinder algorithm was able to find one or more topologically correct path(s) for the specific edge in the iteration.
- src_coords: the coordinates for the source block,
- src_kind: the kind of the source block,
- tgt_coords: if `iter_type` is discovery (target block placed as part of previous operations), the coordinates of the target block, else "TBD",
- tgt_zx_type: the ZX type of the target block, irrespective of `iter_type`,
- tgt_kind: if `iter_type` is discovery (target block placed as part of previous operations), the kind of the target block, else "TBD",
- num_tent_coords_received: the number of tentative coordinates received (many if `iter_type` is creation, one if `iter_type` is discovery),
- num_tent_coords_filled: the number of tentative coordinates that the pathfinder algorithm was able to find topologically correct paths to,
- max_manhattan_src_to_any_tent_coord: the Manhattan distance between the source and the tentative coordinate that is furthest away from it,
- len_longest_path: the lenght of the longest path returned by the algorithm, in grid units counting the lenght of all cubes/pipes in path,
- num_visitation_attempts: the number of sites (coordinate, kind, direction) the pathfinder tested to determine if a new block could be placed there,
- num_sites_visited: the number of times that, having tested a given site, the algorithm "visited" the site,
- iter_duration: the total duration of the specific iteration of the pathfinder algorithm (and to be clear, there will be many iterations of the pathfinder algorithm per circuit run).

### Params (one log per cycle/circuit run)
- unique_run_id: the unique identifier for the specific run of the full algorithmic flow,
- run_success: whether the process was successful, i.e., it produced a complete lattice surgery/space-time diagram of the original circuit,
- circuit_name: the name of the circuit,
- run_params: the main parameters needed to replicate the run.
- edge_paths: a list of the original ZX edges processed successfully in the order in which the algorithm processed them.

### Debug (optional logs as needed)
Same as "params" but only for runs identified as edge cases.
